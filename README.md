# Secondhand Front-End

This project is the user interface for Secondhand, a marketplace for users to sell the stuff that they no longer use. It allows you to create an account, edit your profile, and your products. Users can also visit other users' profiles, navigate through the shop by searching for products, filter them by category and price range, and access the contact information of other users to set up the sale.
